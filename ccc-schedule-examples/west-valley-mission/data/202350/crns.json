This course provides a basis for a better understanding of the socio-economic, cultural and political conditions of key race-ethnic social groups, and explores the evolution, impact, and future of Ethnic Studies itself. Students have an opportunity to examine the history of social justice and racial equality movements in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s through to the present, and analyze the emergence of Ethnic Studies as an academic discipline to provide a relevant education in contrast to ethno-centrism, eurocentrism, and white supremacy in the U.S. Course materials encourage the use of applied methodologies in Social Justice and Ethnic Studies in order to provide a depth of insight into struggles, and mobilization strategies for equity, self-determination, liberation, decolonization, and anti-racism.",
