A variety of critical lenses will be used in the study of literature, including critical race, gender, and sexuality studies, and critical and comparative ethnic studies. We will consider how literature is fundamental in working through social justice issues within the Latina/o communities and at large. The course is cross listed as ETH 013.",

This course examines and contextualizes representative literary texts written in (or translated to) English by authors who, since the sixteenth century, through the emergence of the Latinx Literature movement in the twentieth century and up to now, have self-identified as Hispanic/Latinx and have addressed the varied traditions, conflicts, and transformations experienced by Latinx peoples in the United States.",

Solution techniques include row operations, Gaussian elimination, and matrix algebra. It investigates the properties of vectors in two and three dimensions, leading to the notion of an abstract vector space. Vector space and matrix theory are presented including topics such as inner products, norms, orthogonality, eigenvalues, eigenspaces, and linear transformations. Selected applications of linear algebra are included.",
