The motions of the celestial bodies are explained in the historical context of geocentric and heliocentric models. The course also covers the nature of light and employs telescopic observations to explore the properties of stars and their evolution. An investigation of the stages in the life of a star from birth to the different forms of stellar death is also offered.

This course introduces the use of probability techniques, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and predictive techniques to support decision-making. Students have the opportunity to explore descriptive statistics; probability and sampling distributions; statistical inference; correlation and linear regression; analysis of variance, chi-square and t-tests; and application of technology for statistical analysis including the interpretation of the relevance of the statistical findings. Students are invited to experiment with data from disciplines including business, social sciences, psychology, life science, health science, and education.",

The course combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design. As a byproduct, it is also meant to teach students some basic Python programming language syntax, and how to apply it to solve problems.",

    "CAT_DESC": "This course introduces students to the study of women and gender, from an intersectional perspective. The course provides an overview of the “waves” of women’s rights movements in U.S. history and debates about women’s roles in society. With this grounding in a variety of feminist discourses, students have the opportunity to explore contemporary women’s rights issues in both local and global contexts. Topics include: the social construction of gender, race, class, sexualities, and disabilities in different cultures; women’s sexualities and gender identities; health and reproductive issues; family structures; violence against women; the economics of women’s labor, paid and unpaid; education, political activism and social justice. All genders are equally welcome in this course. Honors Introduction to Women's Studies uses the pedagogical methods common to all Honors courses: interdisciplinary, writing-intensive, collaborative, and experiential instruction. As an honors course, students will be expected to conduct independent research and analysis, apply critical thinking skills, and develop their knowledge of women's and gender rights and struggles with a global perspective.",
