Cultural anthropologists seek to understand the broad arc of human experience focusing on a set of central issues: how people around the world make their living (subsistence patterns); how they organize themselves socially, politically and economically; how they communicate; how they relate to each other through family and kinship ties; what they believe about the world (belief systems); how they express themselves creatively (expressive culture); how they make distinctions among themselves such as through applying gender, racial and ethnic identity labels; how they have shaped and been shaped by social inequalities such as colonialism; and how they navigate culture change and processes of globalization that affect us all. Ethnographic case studies highlight these similarities and differences, and introduce students to how anthropologists do their work, employ professional anthropological research ethics, and apply their perspectives and skills to understand humans around the globe.",

The course requires a higher level of critical legal analysis beyond the non-honors section. This course is an introduction to the law and its relevance to business in general. The course introduces the meaning and sources of law in business, the organization of courts and court procedures, and the fundamental principles of the law in various aspects of business, with a particular focus on contract law. A fundamental understanding of common law principles is examined by analyzing selected cases, court decisions, and business transactions. Topics covered include sources of law and ethics, constitutional law, the court system, contracts, torts, agency, labor and employment, real property, product liability, criminal law, business organizations, and judicial and administrative processes.",

Students are coached on methods of critical inquiry, argumentation and advocacy, on how to identify fallacies in reasoning and language, and the relationship between reasoning and language. Students have the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of how to test evidence and evidence sources, advance a reasoned position, and defend and refute arguments. Students are invited to reflect critically and apply their understanding of critical debate concepts and processes through the analysis and construction of oral and written arguments. Students are guided on how to analyze, present, and evaluate arguments of themselves and others through two or more live debates. Students are coached in writing substantial and sequential essays, which may include a combination of process drafts, inquiry-driven research collection, peer responses, critical argumentation, and reflections that consider overall learning and expansion of knowledge.",

Readings cover a variety of literary forms: novels, short stories, poems, drama, autobiography, and/or essays. This course will review Latina/o literature in relation to political movements and consider how Latina/o literature engages issues of race, gender, class, sexuality, immigration, colonialism, and decolonialism, while exploring diverse spaces in which Latina/os make community in the United States. A variety of critical lenses will be used in the study of literature, including critical race, gender, and sexuality studies, and critical and comparative ethnic studies. We will consider how literature is fundamental in working through social justice issues within the Latina/o communities and at large. The course is cross listed as ETH 013.",

Topics include: integration, techniques of integration, infinite sequences and series, polar and parametric equations, and applications of integration. This course is primarily for science, technology, engineering & math majors. Honors work emphasizes a deeper study of integral calculus via the study of proofs using analytic techniques, real-world problems, and special applied projects.",

The goal of this course is to teach students data science as a way of thinking. The course combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from real-world phenomenon, the course asks how one analyzes the data so as to understand that phenomenon. The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design. As a byproduct, it is also meant to teach students some basic Python programming language syntax, and how to apply it to solve problems.",

This last in this series of courses is designed for all students, including music and musical theater majors, to improve the singing voice and develop the ability to sing confidently in front of others. Topics include the fundamentals of healthy vocal production: proper posture and breath to sing; tone production; diction; expression; and music notation reading skills. Individual vocal problems are assessed and exercises are given to help strengthen and improve the voice. Students have the opportunity to sing together and individually for class. Students also have the opportunity to interpret and perform literature from many vocal genres including jazz.",
