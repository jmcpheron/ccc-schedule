The motions of the celestial bodies are explained in the historical context of geocentric and heliocentric models. The course also covers the nature of light and employs telescopic observations to explore the properties of stars and their evolution. An investigation of the stages in the life of a star from birth to the different forms of stellar death is also offered. The course also examines the origins of the galaxies and the fate of the Universe.",

As an honors course, there will be focus on analytical writing and an emphasis on a higher degree of student participation and leadership in class discussions and other interactive teaching/learning techniques that are generally unsuitable for larger undergraduate classes. This course examines African American Literature from the 1700s to the present. Emphasis is given to the development of a body of literature that attests to the mastery and enhancement by Black writers of the prevailing literary forms in each era in America’s cultural, social, and political history. Students in the course have the opportunity to examine how literature reflects the experiences of Africans adapting to life in new\nworld America and carving out a new identity complete with the development of new literary styles and conventions. The literature is examined through lenses of conventional critical theory and elements of literature.",
