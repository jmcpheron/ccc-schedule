The course commences with a study of the night sky including the motions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars. The motions of the celestial bodies are explained in the historical context of geocentric and heliocentric models. The course also covers the nature of light and employs telescopic observations to explore the properties of stars and their evolution. An investigation of the stages in the life of a star from birth to the different forms of stellar death is also offered. The course also examines the origins of the galaxies and the fate of the Universe.",

By understanding general ecological principles and major ecosystems on earth, we can evaluate how the human population impacts our planet by its growth and resource use, and what the implications are for ecosystems, biodiversity, as well as human health and welfare. Topics include: human population growth, food and water supplies, pollution, global climate change, energy use and sustainable development. Grade only.",

It investigates the properties of vectors in two and three dimensions, leading to the notion of an abstract vector space. Vector space and matrix theory are presented including topics such as inner products, norms, orthogonality, eigenvalues, eigenspaces, and linear transformations. Selected applications of linear algebra are included.",

Students must create a video recording of your audition and upload to a private YouTube channel or cloud-based storage (such as Dropbox, Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, etc.), then send the link to Dr. Troy Davis for review at troy.davis@westvalley.edu Please play the following: 1. Two major scales and two minor scales of your choice. 2. One piece of solo literature for your instrument (this can be a sonata, concerto, solo from a piece of band or orchestra music, in popular or classical styles). If you're auditioning for jazz, this should be one chorus of a standard, which includes one chorus of you improvising (no backing track is necessary). Contact Dr. Troy Davis at troy.davis@westvalley.edu with problems or questions. Continuing students: Juried performance in the previous semester (during assigned Final Exam time) constitutes the audition for continuing students, by which continuing students must receive a C or higher. Students receiving less than C will be placed on probation. Students receiving a second semester of less than C will be ineligible for this class.",

    "CAT_DESC": "The course offers an interdisciplinary study of race and ethnicity in the United States, with a focus on social justice movements of U.S. ethnic and racial groups. This course provides a basis for a better understanding of the socio-economic, cultural and political conditions of key race-ethnic social groups, and explores the evolution, impact, and future of Ethnic Studies itself. Students have an opportunity to examine the history of social justice and racial equality movements in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s through to the present, and analyze the emergence of Ethnic Studies as an academic discipline to provide a relevant education in contrast to ethno-centrism, eurocentrism, and white supremacy in the U.S. Course materials encourage the use of applied methodologies in Social Justice and Ethnic Studies in order to provide a depth of insight into struggles, and mobilization strategies for equity, self-determination, liberation, decolonization, and anti-racism.",
