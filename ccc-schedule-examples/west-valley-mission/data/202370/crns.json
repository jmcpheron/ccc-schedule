Solution techniques include row operations, Gaussian elimination, and matrix algebra. It investigates the properties of vectors in two and three dimensions, leading to the notion of an abstract vector space. Vector space and matrix theory are presented including topics such as inner products, norms, orthogonality, eigenvalues, eigenspaces, and linear transformations. Selected applications of linear algebra are included.",

As an honors course, there is a focus on analytical writing and exploring the field through reading primary source research. This course introduces the use of probability techniques, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and predictive techniques to support decision-making. Students have the opportunity to explore descriptive statistics; probability and sampling distributions; statistical inference; correlation and linear regression; analysis of variance, chi-square and t-tests; and application of technology for statistical analysis including the interpretation of the relevance of the statistical findings. Students are invited to experiment with data from disciplines including business, social sciences, psychology, life science, health science, and education.",

This course also examines what is a meaningful way to go towards one's death, and what is the \"good life\" and therefore a good death.  Required readings are taken from classic texts of Western and non-Western philosophy and religion, as well as contemporary American feminist philosophy, and African, aborigine, and native American sources.",
