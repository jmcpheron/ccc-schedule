Ethnographic case studies highlight these similarities and differences, and introduce students to how anthropologists do their work, employ professional anthropological research ethics, and apply their perspectives and skills to understand humans around the globe.",

Readings cover a variety of literary forms: novels, short stories, poems, drama, autobiography, and/or essays. This course will review Latina/o literature in relation to political movements and consider how Latina/o literature engages issues of race, gender, class, sexuality, immigration, colonialism, and decolonialism, while exploring diverse spaces in which Latina/os make community in the United States. A variety of critical lenses will be used in the study of literature, including critical race, gender, and sexuality studies, and critical and comparative ethnic studies. We will consider how literature is fundamental in working through social justice issues within the Latina/o communities and at large. The course is cross listed as ENG 013.",

Given data arising from real-world phenomenon, the course asks how one analyzes the data so as to understand that phenomenon. The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design. As a byproduct, it is also meant to teach students some basic Python programming language syntax, and how to apply it to solve problems.",
