    "CAT_DESC": "This course introduces students to the study of women and gender, from an intersectional perspective. The course provides an overview of the “waves” of women’s rights movements in U.S. history and debates about women’s roles in society. With this grounding in a variety of feminist discourses, students have the opportunity to explore contemporary women’s rights issues in both local and global contexts. Topics include: the social construction of gender, race, class, sexualities, and disabilities in different cultures; women’s sexualities and gender identities; health and reproductive issues; family structures; violence against women; the economics of women’s labor, paid and unpaid; education, political activism and social justice. All genders are equally welcome in this course. Honors Introduction to Women's Studies uses the pedagogical methods common to all Honors courses: interdisciplinary, writing-intensive, collaborative, and experiential instruction. As an honors course, students will be expected to conduct independent research and analysis, apply critical thinking skills, and develop their knowledge of women's and gender rights and struggles with a global perspective.",
