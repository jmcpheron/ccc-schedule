The following issues are also explored: the possibility of disembodied existence, the nature of consciousness, the nature and significance of individuality and personal identity, concepts of reincarnation or transmigration of souls as these appear in major religious traditions, the nature and significance of so-called “paranormal” experiences, and the meaning of salvation or liberation or transcendence in major religious traditions (concepts of heaven, nirvana, moksa, satori, etc.). This course also examines what is a meaningful way to go towards one's death, and what is the \"good life\" and therefore a good death.  Required readings are taken from classic texts of Western and non-Western philosophy and religion, as well as contemporary American feminist philosophy, and African, aborigine, and native American sources.",
