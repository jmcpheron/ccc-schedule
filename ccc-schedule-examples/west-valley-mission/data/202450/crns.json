Special education laws, the identification and referral process, the development and implementation of an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) and an Individual Education Program (IEP), methods of intervention, and case management are explored. Students are given an opportunity to conduct an observation of children and converse with family members and/or community agencies.",
