Historical themes will be analyzed through an intersectional lens that interrogates categories of identity and power such as race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality. The course explores theoretical concepts and socio-historical processes including colonization and migration; racialization, the development of race as a social category, and the construction of citizenship; the relationship between race and U.S. imperialism; the persistence of social inequalities; and the long historical struggle for racial justice.

Students will engage the web as critical writers and readers in order to move past being simply consumers and empower them in this digital networked era. Practical experience, emphasizing content, organization and delivery, will be required in at least three speaking situations, specifically including persuasive and informative speaking.
